            <h2>The History of Gladiators</h2>
            <p>
                Gladiators were fighters in ancient Rome who entertained audiences by engaging in combat with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. 
                They were usually slaves, prisoners of war, or condemned criminals, but some volunteered to become gladiators to gain fame and fortune.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gladiatorial games were held in massive amphitheaters like the Colosseum, drawing thousands of spectators. These events showcased Rome's military might and offered thrilling spectacles. 
                Some gladiators became famous and were celebrated like modern-day athletes.
