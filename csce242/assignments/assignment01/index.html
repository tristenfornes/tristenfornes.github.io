    <h1>The Wonders of Space</h1>
    <p>Space is so big and full of mysteries, and it’s something people have wondered about for centuries. It’s amazing to think about all the stars, planets, and galaxies out there. Scientists work hard to figure out how everything works and where we fit in the universe. Even though we’ve learned a lot, there’s still so much we don’t know.</p>
    <p>With new technology, we can explore space in ways people couldn’t even dream of before. Telescopes like the James Webb let us see far into the universe. Missions like going back to the Moon make space feel closer to us. Space exploration is exciting because it shows us what’s possible when people work together.</p>
